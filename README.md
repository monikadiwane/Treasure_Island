# Treasure_Island
Treasure Island is a game of bluffing and adventure in which the goal is to travel across islands while asking clues to search for the treasure.

We start with the crossroad to travel ahead in search of treasure.

* 'You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
* 'You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
* "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which colour do you choose?"
* "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
* "You found the treasure! You Win!"
* "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
* "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
* "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
* "You fell into a hole. Game Over."
